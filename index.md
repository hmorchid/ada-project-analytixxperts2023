The topic of diversity is gaining increasing attention nowadays. Many studies, like [this McKinsey & Company report](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/why-diversity-matters), affirms that diversity is not just a buzzword but a pivotal aspect of business success. We would like to assess whether this phenomenon is also applicable to the movie industry.
Consider the groundbreaking success of movies like Black Panther and Barbie. These films not only shattered box office records but also marked a significant cultural moment by celebrating diversity in ethnicity and gender, respectively. Their success prompts a deeper reflexion: Is there a tangible link between a film's performance, i.e its box office earnings and public ratings, and its cast's diversity ?
