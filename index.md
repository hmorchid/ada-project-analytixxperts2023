The topic of diversity is gaining increasing attention nowadays. Many studies, like [this McKinsey & Company report](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/why-diversity-matters) or [this research](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167208328062), aim to understand why it leads to improved research, financial outcomes, and performance. We would like to assess whether this phenomenon is also applicable to the movie industry and what usage this domain makes of diversity, which will be defined in this work by the ethnicity and the gender of actors. In this analysis, we will try to evaluate the impact of the casting's diversity on movies' performances.
