The topic of diversity is gaining increasing attention nowadays. Many studies, [this McKinsey & Company report](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/why-diversity-matters) or [this research](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167208328062), affirms that diversity is not just a buzzword but a pivotal aspect of creative and business success. We would like to assess whether this phenomenon is also applicable to the movie industry. Have you ever wondered if the ethnic and gender diversity of actors in a movie can influence its box office earnings or public ratings ? We're set to explore this question. 
Consider the groundbreaking success of movies like « Black Panther » and « Barbie » . These films not only shattered box office records but also marked a significant cultural moment by celebrating diversity in ethnicity and gender, respectively. Their success prompts a deeper reflexion: Is there a tangible link between the diversity of a film's cast and its performance ?
